Will You Be My Valentine? 💌

A fun and interactive webpage to ask someone to be your Valentine! This project is designed to be lighthearted and playful, but please use it responsibly and with respect for others' feelings.

How It Works 🛠️

This project consists of a simple webpage with a "Yes" and "No" button:

Clicking the "No" button changes its text to a series of playful messages, while making the "Yes" button grow larger.

Clicking the "Yes" button redirects the user to a celebratory page (yes_page.html).

A cute GIF is displayed to set the mood.

The design is fully responsive, ensuring a great experience on all screen sizes.

Features ✨

Interactive Buttons: The "No" button cycles through funny responses, and the "Yes" button grows.
